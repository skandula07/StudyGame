# Vectors
- [[Vectors act like resizable arrays]].

## Declaring a vector
- [[General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();]]  
- Example: Vector<Integer> v = new Vector(); [[Which continent is the driest inhabited continent on Earth? ::: Australia. ...Hard]]

- [[type needs to be a valid reference type]]

## Adding an element to a vector
- [[v.add(object of type);]]

- [[Reminder - go back  and review clearing a vector!]]
