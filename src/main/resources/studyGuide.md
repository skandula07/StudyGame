# Java Arrays
- An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type
- Which country is famous for its tulips and windmills? :::The Netherlands. ...Easy

## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;
- only creates a reference
- no array has actually been created yet

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- What is the largest lake in North America? ::: The largest lake is Lake Superior. ...Hard
- numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.
- Gotcha: Array size is not modifiable once instantiated.
- WOO

# Vectors
- Vectors act like resizable arrays

## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
- Which continent is the driest inhabited continent on Earth? ::: Australia. ...Hard
- type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);
- Reminder - go back  and review clearing a vector!
